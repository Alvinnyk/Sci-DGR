## Convert pdf to json
Make directory named 'json' and 'papers'. Put all pdfs to be converted in the 'papers' directory.


Run the following command to get the papers in json format
```
java -Xmx6g -jar science-parse-cli-assembly-2.0.3.jar ./papers -o ./json
```
The json file would be the parsed version of the paper
